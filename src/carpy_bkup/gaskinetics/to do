I'm not happy with this module. The atom side works, although is messy. The
molecular bonding side doesn't really work all that well.

Atmospheres depends on this module for the gas model.

Rather than work chemistry out from the ground up, I should lean on a library
or a defined set of gases, instead of trying to come up with code that can
procedurally come up with properties from basic principles of atomic bonding.

Or maybe do atomic bonding, but really well this time (copium inhaleeee).
