# TODO: Implement shockwave (normal, oblique, conical) methods, as well as different types of flow.
#   The methods should support real and ideal gas behaviour for isentropic flows.

# It might be an idea to propagate input and output fluid state objects? But then it wouldn't really lend itself to
# quickly identifying, for example, the temperature ratio over the shock. That would be an argument in favour of object
# -oriented design, but does not really make sense from an architecture complexity perspective...

# Some cool stuff on isentropic normal shocks, which could be easily extended to oblique shocks,
