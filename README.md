carpy is an open source project for those interested in the methodology and
approach to the conceptual-level design of fixed-wing aircraft. This library
provides its users with access to a variety of design tools for conceptual
analysis - carpy is designed to complement and not substitute a comprehensive
and detailed study of a vehicle concept.

Users will find:

- Virtual (design) atmospheres
- Hassle-free conversions between systems of units
- `[WorkinProgress]` Constraint Analysis Methods
- `[WorkInProgress]` Propulsion models and Engine Performance Decks
- *...and much more* `[WorkInProgress]`

For a detailed description of the library, please consult the documentation. To
get started, follow the instructions below.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Getting Started

### Installation

`carpy` is written for (and tested in) Python version 3.9.5.

On most systems you should be able to simply open an operating system terminal
and at the command prompt type

    $ pip install carpy

or

    $ python -m pip install carpy

NOTE: `pip` is a Python package; if it is not available on your system, download
[get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and run it in Python by
entering

    $ python get-pip.py

at the operating system prompt.

An alternative approach to installing carpy is to clone the GitHub repository
using `git`, by typing

    $ git clone https://github.com/yaseen157/carpy.git

at the command prompt. Following a successful clone of files to your machine,
navigate to the library root (this contains the file `pyproject.toml`). At this
point, you may enter the following:

    $ python -m pip install ./

Should you find that your installation requires packages you do not have in your
current Python environment, install them by typing this in the same prompt:

    $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

### A 'Hello world' example: Atmospheric properties

There are several options for running the examples shown here: you could copy
and paste them into a `.py` file, save it and run it in Python, or you could
enter the lines, in sequence, at the prompt of a Python terminal. You could also
copy and paste them into a Jupyter notebook
(`.ipynb` file) cell and execute the cell.

```python
"""'Hello World' example to introduce users to carpy atmospheres."""
from carpy.environment import ISA1975
from carpy.utility import Quantity

# Instantiate an atmosphere object:
# International Standard Atmosphere with a +10C offset
atm = ISA1975(T_offset=10)

# Query the ambient density in this model at 41,000 feet 
# noinspection PyTypeChecker
print(f"{atm} density at 41,000 feet:",
      atm.rho(altitude=Quantity(41_000, "ft")))
```

You should see the following output:

    ISA1975(+10¬∞C) density at 41,000 feet: [0.28740209] kg m‚Åª¬≥

You can learn more about `carpy`'s capabilities through the exemplary
[notebooks](./docs/carpy/notebooks).
